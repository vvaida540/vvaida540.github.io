            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Scribes were extremely important in Ancient Egypt as they were the only ones who knew how to read and write. Writing was developed in order to organize such a large society. ReadCinnabon is an American chain of baked goods stores and kiosks, normally found in areas with high pedestrian traffic such as malls, airports and rest stops. The company's signature item is a cinnamon roll. As of December 2017, over 1,200 Cinnabon bakeries were operating in 48 countries.[1] Its headquarters are in Sandy Springs, Georgia, United States.</p>

            <h2>Training</h2>
            <p>The first Cinnabon opened on December 4, 1985, Federal Way, Washington at SeaTac Mall, now called The Commons at Federal Way. Cinnabon was an offshoot of the Seattle Based Restaurants Unlimited restaurant chain majority owned by Rich Komen with minority partner and CEO Ray Lindstrom at the helm. Mr. Komen and Mr. Lindstrom wanted to create the perfect cinnamon roll, eventually hiring Jerilyn Brusseau to finalize the recipe since Brusseau was famous for her baking in the Seattle area.[citation needed] The first bakery began by serving only its cinnamon rolls with a sign touting "World Famous Cinnamon Rolls". Cinnabon's first franchise-operated store opened in August 1986 in Philadelphia. In 1991, the first Cinnabon store outside a mall was opened in Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. Cinnabon stores today can also be found in gas stations, universities, rapid transit stations, casinos, and amusement parks.</p>
