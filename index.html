            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Scribes were extremely important in Ancient Egypt as they were the only ones who knew how to read and write. Writing was developed in order to organize such a large society. ReadCinnabon is an American chain of baked goods stores and kiosks, normally found in areas with high pedestrian traffic such as malls, airports and rest stops. The company's signature item is a cinnamon roll. As of December 2017, over 1,200 Cinnabon bakeries were operating in 48 countries.[1] Its headquarters are in Sandy Springs, Georgia, United States.</p>

            <h2>Training</h2>
            <p>Ancient Egyptians not only decorated their tombs with images and texts, but recorded and documented all aspects of life. The ancient Egyptian system of writing was so complex that it required skills which could be mastered only after years of specialized training. The scribe had to be familiar with different styles of writing. Hieroglyphics dating back to the Old Kingdom, around 3000 BC, was a system of picture writing.  Symbols, hieroglyphs, were used instead of words and letters and stood for an idea, for the object they resembled, or for a totally different thing. Only knowledgeable people could understand them. Initially there were around 700 symbols, but by 300 BC, 6000 symbol were in the written language. They could be combined to have different meanings and could be stretched or scaled to fit in different texts. Egyptian texts were written in perfectly aligned columns and rows and could be read from left to right, right to left, or vertically up or down depending on the indication placed by the scribe. The other two styles of writing used were the hieratic writing, a simplified cursive version of hieroglyphics used mostly on papyrus documents, and the demotic script (from around 600 BC) which used abbreviated signs and was used for lists and documents for faster writing. To learn all these a scribe started his training at five, usually at a temple school or at home with his father, if he was a scribe. Around the age of nine he went on for a more formal training in special scribe schools which he could graduate in ten-twelve years. Students needed to memorize around 700 symbols, the basics, and to practice them over and over again for at least two years. They practiced writing on wood, flakes of stone, and broken bits of pottery. As their skills improved they were allowed to write on papyrus. A highly skilled scribe knew and could write around 3000 hieroglyphs. A scribe perfected his technique using specific tools of his trade, which he carried with him everywhere he went. These were a wooden palette with brushes and reed pens and a roll of papyrus. Ink was carried in a flat pallet with two depressions cut into it; one for red ink and the other for black ink. Red ink was used for important or magical terms, to indicate titles, headings and to mark the beginning of a new section of text, and by tutors when correcting the work of their students. The scribal training was restricted to boys from middle or upper class families, but there is also evidence that boys from lower class families and even girls learned to write. The son of a scribe inherited is fatherâ€™s job after completing his training.</p>

            <h2>Difficulties</h2>
            <p>Discipline in an ancient Egyptian scribe schools was strictly enforced. Teachers treated their students harshly, beatings being a common practice. Students had classes from dawn until sunset and were supposed to pay attention, practice, study and stay focused the whole time. They were punished for being lazy or for not paying attention.</p>

            <h2>Society</h2>
            <p>In the social pyramid of ancient Egypt scribes were one level below priests. Scribes, which could be considered the civil servants of Egypt, were central to the functioning of administration, the army, and the priesthood. They played an important role in the Egyptian society by being tax collectors, law administrators, by writing legal documents, recording harvests, food supply and distribution, documenting rainfall and water levels of the Nile, conducting census of the population, overseeing the constructions of important buildings by planning, surveying and supervising, recording medical procedures, and genealogies. Scribes were involved in all areas of the Egyptian society. The scribes were highly regarded in ancient Egypt and had privileges like: did not have to pay tax, undertake military service or perform manual labor. Anyone that had the right training could become a scribe no matter from which social class he emerged. Becoming a scribe was one of the ways people could climb on the social ladder. The job itself was well paid. With hard work and constant study one could be promoted and advance jobs like engineers, priests, judges, doctors, and teachers.</p>
